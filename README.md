Abstract

In this note, it is shown that a three-machine power system with 2 PV and 1 slack busses can be modelled by using two Single Machine Infinite Bus models. It was found that a relation between the active powers of the two models at final resulted equations maintains interaction between two SMIB models. It provides a theoretical background to understand dynamic behavior of such power networks.
